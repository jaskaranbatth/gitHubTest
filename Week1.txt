Week 1

-What is use for.

When we develop the application?

-Reusability
-Maintainability
-Highly maintainable (Code easy to understand)
-flexibility(Should be add new feautres without breakable)
-Extensibility(We can add new feautures without modifing the old code)



Main
>Inheritance (Code reuse,Behaviour from the main class)

>Polymorphism (Same message to different object of subclases and
each have their own different version)
>Encapsulation(Hiding information)
>Abstraction



Absract Method
(If the method is abstract that mean that u cannot 
define in the super class and you have to define 
have into subclass)

-If the method is static then you dont have to 
create an object to call the method.


Rules of Principle:
1) Always use most restracted modifier = Private



Main advantages are :
1 -  works simantounsly

disadvantages
-If reporatry crash data lost
- reporarty get update then workers cant work on file.
